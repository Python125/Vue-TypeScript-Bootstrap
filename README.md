This project is a digital mock-up of The Leaky Cauldron, the iconic pub and inn from the Harry Potter universe. Designed to emulate a restaurant website, it allows users to explore an interactive menu with traditional British food items, view breakfast, lunch, and dinner options, and discover various beverage options. Built with Vue.js, Bootstrap, SCSS, and TypeScript, this project demonstrates a responsive and visually immersive restaurant layout.

The main goal of this project was to practice creating a fully functional and engaging restaurant-style website with Vue.js while leveraging Bootstrap for rapid layout development. SCSS provided the ability to create modular and easily adjustable styles, while TypeScript contributed type safety and improved code reliability.

# Technologies Used
- Vue.js: To structure the application and handle component-based interactivity.
- Bootstrap: For the responsive layout and pre-designed UI components.
- SCSS: For custom, modular styling on top of Bootstrap.
- TypeScript: To add type checking and ensure more robust code.
